
ICMP Qos


On this lab I marked the ICPM traffic getting into interface f0/0 on R1 and
I reserved 50% bandwidth of the output interface s0/0 for the marked traffic,
so whenever there is congestion the selected traffic will have priority and 
a reserved bandwidth to avoid the dropping of the selected traffic.
